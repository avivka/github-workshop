This repository is for a workshop on GitHub:


GitHub Enterprise Administrator Workshop Plan 

Event Details 

Join us for an immersive deep-dive into GitHub Enterprise - the industry-leading developer platform for source control, automation, and secure software delivery at scale.  

This workshop brings together GitHub experts and platform practitioners for a series of advanced, hands-on sessions covering enterprise governance, repository and branch policies, GitHub Actions security, and supply-chain protection.  

Participants will learn best-practice architectures, explore real-world governance patterns, and understand how to apply the GitHub Well-Architected Framework to securely operate GitHub at enterprise scale.

Sessions 

Welcome and Introduction (10 minutes) 

Introduce facilitators and participants 

Outline workshop goals and structure 

Introduce the GitHub Well-Architected Framework 

 

GitHub Enterprise Overview: Deployment Models & Use Cases (30 minutes) 

An overview of GitHub Enterprise deployment options and when to use each, including GitHub Enterprise Cloud, Enterprise Managed Users (EMU), Data Residency, and GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES). 
This session helps organizations understand how different deployment models impact identity management, compliance, governance, and security, and how enterprises typically align GitHub architectures to regulated and large-scale environments. 

Enterprise Repository Governance at Scale (90 minutes) 

A deep dive into building consistent, enterprise-grade governance across repositories using modern GitHub capabilities. 
Participants learn how to move from fragmented, per-repository controls to organization-wide policies using Rulesets, enabling secure and compliant development workflows at scale. 

Topics include enforcing pull request workflows, mandatory reviews, CODEOWNERS, security checks, commit integrity, and branch protections, as well as designing governance baselines for product code, infrastructure-as-code, and high-criticality systems. 
Includes live demonstrations and hands-on exercises based on real enterprise scenarios. 

 

GitHub Actions Security & Supply Chain Governance (85 minutes) 

Focused on securing automation and CI/CD workflows, this session covers how enterprises can safely scale GitHub Actions while reducing risk. 
Participants learn how to govern runners, isolate environments, and apply least-privilege access to workflows. 

The session also addresses software supply-chain security, including trusted actions usage, dependency review, artifact integrity, and secure authentication to cloud providers. 
Hands-on demos show how to identify and harden insecure workflows using recommended enterprise patterns. 

 

GitHub Enterprise Security Baseline (60 minutes) 

An overview of GitHub’s built-in security capabilities and how to establish a strong default security posture across the organization. 
This session covers code scanning, secret scanning and push protection, dependency security, and centralized security visibility. 

Participants gain a practical understanding of how GitHub supports secure software development by default, and how security signals can be surfaced and managed at scale. 

 

 

 

 

Well-Architected Applied: Governance & Security Assessment (15 minutes) 

A guided assessment using the GitHub Well-Architected Framework to evaluate an organization’s GitHub governance and security maturity. 
Participants assess identity and access controls, repository and automation governance, supply-chain protections, and audit readiness, and leave with a clear set of prioritized risks and recommended improvement actions.
